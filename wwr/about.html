            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>Founded in 1999, Sierra Rafting Co began as a small family-owned business with a passion for river exploration and adventure. Our first excursions took place on the local rivers, where we introduced our guests to the thrill of whitewater rafting. With a commitment to safety and unforgettable experiences, our reputation quickly grew! We were excited as we began attracting adventure seekers from all over.</p>
                <img src="images/rafting56_600.jpg" alt="History Img">
                <p>Over the years, we expanded our offerings to include a variety of trips, from half-day adventures to multi-day expeditions. Our guides are some of the worlds best! They are trained in safety and are knowledgeable about the local ecosystems, making every trip both exciting and educational! Today, we operate on some on some of the same rivers we started on, still providing top-notch rafting experiences while maintaining our family-owned charm and dedication to our guests' satisfaction.</p>
