                <p>Hi! My name is Sydnie, I am a software development major and am excited to learn! I am originally from California, but have been living in Utah for around 4 years now. When I'm not gaming with my wonderful husband or hitting the trails for a hike, you can find me on the volleyball court. I have the cutest cat in the world named Bonnie, she's a super fluffy Siberian cat, with white fur and blue eyes. I currently am a hairstylist, and am extremely passionate about making people look and feel their best. </p>
